# Plan: the console's first frame before its MCP servers (#319)

Status: shipped from `fix/319-console-first-frame-before-mcp`. Issue #319
reported the console hanging on startup after a large skill marketplace had
been synced; the measurements below found the skills innocent and the
configured MCP servers guilty. The current reference is
`docs/features/mcp.md` (*MCP Server Lifecycle*) and `docs/surfaces/console.md`;
this file keeps the numbers and the decisions as they were taken, including
the one withdrawn in review (pinning `npx` packages, section 5).

## 1. Method

The console is started in a real pty (pexpect + pyte, the driver of
`examples/cli/cli_tui_driver.py`) and the clock runs from the spawn to three
points: the first read of the pty that returned data (one read can carry
more than one frame, so this is when output was first observed), the version
header on screen (the first frame) and the `escape interrupt` hint. Five runs
per case, medians reported, Linux amd64. `examples/cli/bench_tui_startup.py`
runs the skill cases on the demo config; `examples/cli/bench_tui_real.py` runs
a private copy of the operator's real `~/.coddy` (paths rewritten; every file
of the real home is compared before and after, and the report names anything
that changed). In every run the first read that carried the header also
carried the hint, so no frame without the hint was observed; that says what
was on screen, not that a key had been taken. The script has since gained an
input round trip, a probe typed after the hint and timed until the editor
echoes it (`echo` in the results), and the needles are searched in
everything the console wrote as well as on the emulated screen, since a long
`[Skills]` section scrolls the header off a short screen between two reads.
The table of section 2 is the committed run
`examples/cli/bench_results/tui-startup-2026-09-25.json`: release 1.2.17 and
the branch build side by side. The tables of section 3 were measured earlier,
with release 1.2.16 and `main` at 1.2.17, before the input round trip
existed; their result files name the operator's servers and stay out of the
repository.

Two numbers in section 3 were measured by hand, not by the scripts: the cost
of one `npx` spawn (`/usr/bin/time -f '%e s wall, %U s user' timeout 30 npx -y <package> </dev/null`,
package in the npm cache, network up) and the same under a refused proxy
(`HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9 HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:9 NO_PROXY=`,
150 s limit). The operator's `time coddy` is their own observation.

The proxy variants set `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` and npm's own
`npm_config_proxy` / `npm_config_https_proxy` for the console's process and
clear the exclusion lists; a provider row with its own `proxy` setting is
outside their reach (the rows measured were `inherit`). With
`mcp_servers: []` the same variants cost 26-27 ms, so nothing else the
console does before its first frame depends on the network.

## 2. Skills are not the cause

Demo config, an empty working directory, the first frame (header on screen)
for both binaries and the input round trip for the branch build:

| Skill set | Sources | first frame, release 1.2.17 | first frame, branch | probe echoed, branch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | none | 33 ms | 31 ms | 112 ms |
| the operator's 11 | none | 36 ms | 46 ms | 140 ms |
| the operator's 11 | the operator's 3 (one git marketplace, one `marketplace.json` URL, one repository) | 43 ms | 41 ms | 123 ms |
| 300 synthetic `SKILL.md` | none | 54 ms | 54 ms | 152 ms |
| 300 synthetic | one that accepts TCP and never answers | 56 ms | 55 ms | 145 ms |
| 1000 synthetic | none | 114 ms | 109 ms | 236 ms |

`coddy -v` alone takes 8-9 ms. The loader (`skills.Loader.LoadAll`) reads
and parses every `SKILL.md`, about 0.1 ms each: the two-second budget the
issue proposed is some 20 000 skills away. The dead source was never contacted:
nothing at startup reads `skills.sources`, neither in `internal/session` nor
in `external/cli`. Hypothesis 1 of the issue (a blocking manifest refresh)
does not exist in the code; hypothesis 2 (O(N) scanning) is true with a
constant too small to matter.

## 3. The configured MCP servers are

A copy of the operator's real configuration: six `mcp_servers` entries, four
enabled and run through `npx -y <package>` (github, docker, sqlite,
playwright), one disabled, one whose executable does not exist. Same binary,
same pty:

| Variant | release 1.2.16 | main |
|---|---|---|
| real config, empty working directory | 6.48 s | 6.34 s |
| real config, cwd = this repository | 6.44 s | 7.63 s (two runs at 11 s) |
| real config with `mcp_servers: []` | 26 ms | 28 ms |
| real config, the proxy refuses connections | >60 s, not one byte | >60 s, not one byte |
| real config, the proxy accepts and never answers | >60 s, not one byte | >60 s, not one byte |
| `mcp_servers: []`, the proxy refuses | - | 26 ms |
| `mcp_servers: []`, the proxy accepts and never answers | - | 27 ms |

The operator's own `time coddy` (start, two ctrl+c) read 8.3 s real and 1.4 s
of user CPU: the startup above plus the keystrokes, the CPU belonging to the
`npx` processes.

The same measurement once the fix was in, on the same copy of the real
configuration, which by then listed more `npx` servers (the operator had
installed a marketplace of them in the meantime), release 1.2.17 against the
branch build `1.2.17-4-g64ec3ab1`, the operator's proxy in place:

| Variant | release 1.2.17 | branch build |
|---|---|---|
| real config, empty working directory | 34.7 s | 62 ms |
| real config, cwd = this repository | 33.4 s | 59 ms |
| real config with `mcp_servers: []` | 32 ms | 33 ms |
| real config, the proxy refuses connections (branch build only, 3 runs) | - | 55 ms |
| real config, the proxy accepts and never answers (branch build only, 3 runs) | - | 50 ms |

With the servers off the first-frame path, the console with the real
configuration starts as fast as one without MCP servers, and the network
has no say in when it draws.

How long the servers themselves take, measured by the same run through the
console's own account of them (`bench_tui_real.py --mcp-timeout`: the
footer's `MCP n/m` segment from the first frame until it leaves, the rows
for the servers that failed), 26 configured servers:

| Variant | first frame | every server settled | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| network up, 5 runs | 49 ms | 3.5 s (3.1-3.8 s) | 7 connected, 19 failed, the same 19 every run |
| the proxy accepts and never answers, 3 runs | 58 ms | 20.05 s | 0 connected: every server hit the 20 s bound |

The 19 that fail with the network up fail in the release as well, where each
one cost its spawn before the first frame and said nothing; here they are
rows of the transcript with the reason. The 3.5 s is the slowest of 26 concurrent
spawns and handshakes; a prompt sent inside that window waits on
`Connecting MCP servers`, one sent after it starts at once.

What one `npx -y <package>` costs on that machine, package already in the npm
cache, network up:

| Package | Spawn to exit | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` | 1.18 s | runs |
| `mcp-server-docker` | 0.94 s | exit 127 |
| `mcp-server-sqlite` | 1.14 s | exit 1 |
| `@playwright/mcp` | 1.40 s | runs |

Two of the four never worked, and the console paid for them on every start.
With the proxy refusing connections, the cached `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
took **71 s** to start (exit 0): an unpinned spec sends npx to the registry
for `latest` on every run, and npm's defaults are `fetch-retries=2`,
`fetch-retry-mintimeout=10000`, `fetch-retry-maxtimeout=60000`,
`fetch-timeout=300000`.

## 4. Where the time went in the code

`HandleSessionNew` → `buildFreshState` → `connectConfiguredMCPServers` ran
before the console's `App.Start` returned, so before anything was drawn.
`dialConfiguredMCPServers` walked the servers one after another; neither
`mcp.Connect` nor the client set a timeout, and the console handed
`session/new` a context cancelled only by a signal (`external/cli/run.go`).
`mcpReloadTimeout` (30 s) covered only a settings reload. A server that
spawned and stayed silent held the start forever; `npx` without a network was
such a server for as long as npm retried.

## 5. Decisions

- **Every surface dials concurrently, each server under
  `defaultMCPConnectTimeout` = 20 s** (`internal/session/mcp_dial.go`), below
  the 30 s a settings reload shares across sessions. A constant, not a config
  key: once the dial is off the first-frame path the value only bounds one
  waiting turn, and a key would pull in the schema, the docs tables, the
  bundled skill, `config.example.yaml` and the site. `mcp.connect_timeout`
  can be added to `config.MCP` later if a legitimate server needs more.
- **Only the console defers the dial past the first frame** (option A):
  `SetBackgroundMCPConnect` on the manager, `MCPConnectUpdate` as a control
  update the console renders (`MCP 2/5` in the footer, one row per failed or
  held server), `State.WaitMCPConnect` at turn admission. ACP promises
  connected servers when `session/new` returns (`docs/reference/acp-protocol.md`),
  HTTP and Telegram create their session on the first message and would only
  move the wait inside the turn, and `features/mcp_project_trust.feature`
  checks the marker right after `session/new`; deferring everywhere (option B)
  would rewrite all of that for no visible gain.
- **A turn started while the dial is pending waits, bounded**, rather than
  running with the servers connected so far: the model's tool list is fixed
  when the turn starts (`currentToolDefinitions`), a late server would change
  the tools prefix and invalidate the provider's prompt cache, and a turn
  that sees the GitHub tool depending on how fast the operator typed is not a
  behaviour anybody can rely on. Typical dials end before a person submits a
  prompt, so the wait bites only when a server hangs.
- **Coddy does not pin `npx` packages.** The branch first rewrote an
  `npx -y <package>` entry to `<package>@<version>` whenever Settings, `PUT
  /coddy/mcp/{name}` or `config_set` registered one, reading the version from
  the npm registry, and warned about hand-written ones in `--dry-run` and in
  the log. The maintainer's review withdrew it before the merge: the way a
  server's command starts is the operator's responsibility, the same as for
  `uvx`, `docker run` or a binary on `PATH`, and an MCP layer that knows one package
  runner's flags, calls its registry during a save and rewrites the operator's
  arguments is coupled to a tool Coddy does not ship. It also covered only
  stdio servers, while a remote server (streamable HTTP or SSE) can hang the
  same way on a network that accepts the connection and never answers. What
  fixes #319 is transport-agnostic: the bounded concurrent dial and the
  console's background connect above. The measurement of section 3 stays as
  a note for operators in `docs/features/mcp.md` (*Error Handling*): a
  version in `args` keeps `npx` off the network.

## 6. Follow-ups

- A killed `npx` leaves its `node` child until stdin EOF reaches it
  (`exec.CommandContext` has no process group); the timeout makes this more
  frequent than before. The process-group helpers of `internal/platform`
  are the fix.
- The remote console (`--remote`) is not deferred: the server creates the
  session synchronously; it gets the concurrent, bounded dial like every
  surface.

## 7. After the merge with #382

While the branch was open, #382 (the `/mcp` command) landed a concurrent
dial of its own under one deadline for all servers (`mcpStartTimeout`,
30 s), servers that deadline cut short parked and dialed again at the
session's next turn, restored sessions that start nothing until their first
turn, and single-server reconciles for switches and trust. The branch was
rebuilt on that machinery rather than beside it:

- The per-server bound stays, inside the shared deadline. A server that never
  answers now fails on its own 20 s instead of running the 30 s out, so it is
  not parked; parked, it would have cost every later turn another 30 s. Only a
  dial cut short from outside (a save reconnecting many sessions, a request
  that ended) is parked. The single-server reconcile dials through the same
  bound.
- A server that got no answer within its bound is tried exactly once more,
  when the session's next turn starts (`noteConfiguredDial`), and then left
  alone until a reload, its switch or a new session. The first start of an
  `npx -y` package installs it: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything`
  took 16.4 s with an empty npm cache on the operator's laptop, close to the
  bound, and a slower network or a heavier package passes it. Killed at the
  bound, npx keeps what it downloaded, and the next try starts from the
  cache. The set of those servers is kept apart from the servers a switch
  parks, because `RefreshMCPServer` drains the parked set in a loop and would
  otherwise spend the one more try at once.
- The console connects a restored session (`coddy -c`, `/resume`) in the
  background as it does a new one: it loads a session only to continue it.
  Every other surface keeps #382's rule.
- A turn waits for the background connect after its cancel is installed, so
  Stop ends the wait, and the runner is then entered with the cancelled
  context, as after any other stopped step. The parked and deferred dials
  follow the wait.
- A switch or a trust change during the background connect is kept parked
  until the connect settles, and `RefreshMCPServer` waits for it first, so a
  server is neither dialed twice nor left running after it was switched off.
- A reload that supersedes the background connect marks the servers it
  cancelled as cancelled rather than failed and sends the console that last
  snapshot, so the footer clears without a false warning row.

Every kind of server an operator configures is now run through a real turn:
a program, an npm package through the real `npx` (a local folder, so no
registry), a streamable HTTP server and an SSE server, in
`features/mcp_tool_calls.feature` (the HTTP surface, the package registered
through `PUT /coddy/mcp/{name}` and saved as written) and in
`examples/cli/cli_e2e_mcp_servers.py` (the console on a real pty, CI's `cli`
job); `features/cli_tui.feature` covers the background connect of a
program, streamable HTTP and SSE. The last acceptance criterion of #319,
300 skills and a skill source that never answers, is a scenario of
`features/cli_tui.feature` and a case of `examples/cli/cli_e2e_startup.py`
(first frame 117 ms in the pty, the source never contacted), and
`docs/features/skills.md` (*When skills are read*) states what a start
reads.

## 8. Cross-review of the rework

Five reviewers read the rework: Cursor (auto), Devin (SWE-2), and Coddy on
`codex/gpt-5.6-sol`, `neuraldeep/qwen3.8-27b` and `neuraldeep/gpt-oss-120b`.
Confirmed and changed, each with a test where one could hold it:

- The turn's own MCP work - the wait, the one more try, the parked and the
  deferred dials - runs on the turn's context: Stop ends any of it at once,
  and what it cut short stays parked for the next turn instead of counting
  as a server that did not answer.
- A result is classified when its dial returns (`mcpDialResult.CutShort`):
  a server that failed on its own is not parked because another one ran the
  caller's time out afterwards.
- A dial that failed closes whatever it half opened, and a single-server
  dial under an ended context starts nothing.
- The record of the background connect carries its own generation, is kept
  true by a later dial of one of its servers (the one more try, a switch, an
  approval) and is cleared by a reload, so a resumed session shows no stale
  failure or approval notice.
- The record of servers that did not answer is kept under the same lock and
  generation check as the connect's progress, so a late result of a dial a
  reload superseded touches neither; `RefreshMCPServer` clears a server's
  record only once a background connect still running has settled.
- The surface hears about the connect from a goroutine of its own: a surface
  slow to take an update cannot keep the connect from settling, which a
  waiting turn depends on.
- A server switched off, or no longer approved, while the background connect
  dialed it is not installed when it answers.
- The footer keeps the MCP count, the running tasks and the permission mode
  whole together on a narrow line; a trust-gate error that is not a missing
  approval is a warning like the others; the npx scenario skips on a checkout
  without Node instead of failing.

A second round on those fixes found one more thing all four answering
reviewers agreed on: the connect's notifier and a reload that supersedes it
send from two goroutines, so the last snapshot the console applied could be
one read before the reload's. Every change of the record now bumps a
revision the snapshot carries (`MCPConnectUpdate.Generation`), and the
console drops a snapshot older than the last it applied; a reload always
sends the record as it stands before clearing it, even when the connect had
already finished, and the connect's first update goes through its notifier
too, so not even `session/new` waits for the surface. The same round moved
the record to held or cancelled when a switch or a withdrawn approval
closes a server, parked (rather than dropped) a server the gate could not
decide on after the dial, stopped counting cancelled servers, and let the
footer drop the path entirely before it cuts into a note.

Checked and left as they are: servers an ACP client sends keep the 20 s bound
without a second try (documented; only that client can declare them again);
a reload that supersedes the console's background connect clears the footer
and shows no progress of its own dial; `ReloadConfigForSession` runs only
inside a turn of its session (`config_commit`), so no admission of that
session can be waiting beside it; cancelling a context under the state's
lock never calls back into the state, since `context.AfterFunc` runs its
function on a goroutine of its own; the console loads a stored session only
to continue it (a `@session:` mention reads the store and loads nothing).
